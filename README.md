# Unlocking Financial Innovation: JP Morgan's Fintech Journey with Blockchain and Cryptocurrency in Developing Onxy and JPMCoin
## General Overview and Historical Origins
Founded in 1871 by J. Pierpont Morgan, J.P. Morgan is a renowned American financial institution with a rich history dating back to the 19th century. The institution has played a pivotal role in shaping the modern financial landscape of the United States and now has international recognition. 
In the early 2000s, J.P Morgan merged with Chase Manhattan to become what is internationally recognized as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

Over the years, through various mergers and acquisitions, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co has evolved astronomically, becoming a powerhouse in investment banking, asset management, and commercial banking. Its historical significance is underscored by its involvement in critical events such as financing the expansion of railroads, helping stabilize the economy during financial crises, and participating in landmark deals like the formation of U.S. Steel. 
Currently, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co is one of the world's largest and most influential banking institutions, serving a diverse range of clients and contributing to the global financial ecosystem.

The primary focus of this case study is the Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies domain of the JP Morgan company. In light of recent developments, the rise of Fintech, and innovational technologies such as AI, J.P. Morgan has displayed an avid interest in blockchain technology to provide stakeholders with efficient and effective experiences across all other JP Morgan domains as well. 

JP Morgan has developed its own blockchain-based platforms called Quorum and Onyx. Additionally, the bank has explored the use of cryptocurrency, such as JPM Coin, for faster and more efficient cross-border payments and settlement.
## Business Activities & Fintech Domain Trends
The 2022 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co Annual Report finds despite geopolitical turmoil spanning global territories, JP Morgan has been able to maintain robust analytics for 2022. The report finds the “annual net income was $37.7 billion, with a return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 18%” (Dimon). In regards to consumers, J.P. Morgan “extended credit and raised capital of $2.4 trillion for consumers and institutional clients around the world” (Dimon) 

With changing times and the emergence of technological innovations, JP Morgan's primary objective in keeping up with these trends is to develop and maintain a system that will revolutionize its services while simultaneously improving effectiveness and efficiency. 

Through JPM coins implementation in managing blockchain and cryptocurrency, J.P Morgan intends to bridge the challenges faced in cross-border transactions, payments, and settlements. 

According to the 2022 J.P Morgan Annual Report, this domain trend is best characterized as “the journey to the cloud,” emphasizing AI, technological integration, and revolutionizing traditional banking systems and practices. The annual report states J.P. Morgan spent  “$2 billion building new, cloud-based data centers,” working to “modernize,” and has “over 1,000 people involved in data management, more than 900 data scientists (AI and machine learning (ML) experts who create new models) and 600 ML engineers (who write the code to put models in production)” (Dimon). One of these efforts is Onyx and JPM Coin. 

Onyx was launched in 2020 by J.P. Morgan as a blockchain platform to “improve the quality of wholesale payment transactions” (Partz). In fact, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co “reportedly processed nearly $700 billion in short-term loan transactions via Onyx as of April 2023” (Partz). The international impact has been effective and yielded strong outcomes. J.P. Morgan partnered with six central Indian banks to introduce the blockchain-based platform (Partz). JPMorgan’s senior country officer Kaustubh Kulkarni states, “By leveraging blockchain technology to facilitate transactions on a 24x7 basis, the processing is instantaneous and enables GIFT City banks to support their own time-zone and operating hours”  (Partz). This eliminates the current interbank settlement system in which “ transactions could take up to several hours,” and settlements were” not available on Saturdays, Sundays or public holidays” (Partz).

Following this, J.P Morgan officially launched JPM coin, and it has begun “Euro blockchain payments” for corporate entities and “has processed over $300 billion since the system launched” and “processes about $9.8 trillion in daily payments” (Irrera et al.) The usage of JPM coins in Europe is “only made available to its institutional clients, and only for settling payments” because it is operating as a “permissioned blockchain,” which means it  “is a distributed ledger that is not publicly accessible” (Irrera et al.).
## Competitor Analysis
Given that the JPM coin is relatively new to the scene, there are preexisting and new competitors that could undermine the effectiveness, usage, and point of the JPM coin.
Current competitors include but are not limited to Stablecoins, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCS), and Ripple (XRP).

Ripple is the company behind the XRP cryptocurrency. One of their objectives is to offer solutions like RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) to facilitate fast and cost-effective cross-border payments for financial institutions. This is also one of the primary objectives of the JPM coin. 

XRP (Ripple) has demonstrated its efficiency and effectiveness in the past with “cost-effectiveness and real-time transaction capabilities” (Rahma, 2023). Moreover, XRM (Ripple) 
It is capable of reaching consensus “within four seconds” and has acted as a “mediator for currency exchange without the need for intermediaries” (Rahma). Due to these reasons and more, Ripple has partnerships with “over 200 financial institutions” and is becoming one of the “leading fintech unicorns worldwide” (Rahma). 

However, despite this, JPM coin still has the upper hand due to the significant differences in design and applications. JPM coin reduces risks by a large margin because it is an established banking institution, and JPM coin involves JP Morgan as the only creditor offering a “closed network solution” exclusively within the J.P. Morgan Chase & Co ecosystem (Rhama). JPM coin is also more stable and secure, which consumers may value more.
## Conclusion & Formal Recommendations
In summation,  JPM Coin is a pioneering example of how traditional banking institutions integrate the potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to revolutionize financial services. With its stability, security, and unparalleled backing from JPMorgan's vast deposit base, it addresses many of the shortcomings of traditional cross-border payments. The real-time settlement capabilities and reduced credit risks make it an attractive option for institutions engaged in international transactions. While its closed-network approach may limit its influence on the broader cryptocurrency market, JPM Coin undeniably signifies the evolving future of traditional banking. It serves as a testament to the industry's commitment to innovation, efficiency, and adaptability in the ever-changing landscape of global finance. As technology continues to reshape the financial sector, JPM Coin exemplifies how legacy institutions can lead the way in redefining the future of banking.

Moreover, JP Morgan should implement an effective market strategy to deal with market competition and cater to consumers. This strategy should be focused on exemplifying JPM Coin as the best option. Instead of comparing itself to other competitors such as XRM, it should focus entirely on all the positives of JPM coin and why it is the only practical solution to changing times characterized by technological advancements.
